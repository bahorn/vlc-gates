# VLC Logic Gates

Have you ever wanted to evaluate boolean circuits with VLC?
No?
Well now you can.

Just run `run.sh` and it will start VLC (setup for MacOS).
This uses VLCs HTTP server and the VOD VLM feature (soon to be removed rip) to
concat files to emulate lookup tables (which implement the gates).
